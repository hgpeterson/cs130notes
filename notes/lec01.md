## Python stuff

Cool Libraries:
- ruff = Rust/Python linter, very fast (better than pylint)
- networkx = graph algo in python (can't use in this class)

Use Python 3.12

## Schedule

- Project 1: due 1/23
- Project 2: due 2/6
- Project 3: due 2/20
- Project 4: due 3/6
- Project 5: due 3/19

-10% penalty for 1 day late, more after

4 late tokens = 4 late days

## Software Engineering >> Programming

Added concepts: __systematic__, __disciplined__, __maintainable__ 

Phases of software development:

1. Determine software requirements
    - What does it need to do?
2. Design
    - Consider: user-interface, database schema, modularity, extensibility, security, safety, performance, etc.
3. Implement
4. Test
    - __Verification__: Does the code do what _I_ thought it should?
    - __Validation__: Does the code do what _the user_ thought it should?
5. Document
6. Maintain

This course focuses on 2 through 5.

## Waterfall Model

__Idea__: Try to complete each phase before the next phase begins.

- Iterative approach: Each next step informs changes on previous step.

__Real life fail__: At testing/release, user finally sees product, realizes requirements not satisfied.

_Need a way to test requirements first!_

__Problem__: It's impossible to know how long it will take to complete all these steps.
